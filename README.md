## Overview 
Simple demo of the inbuilt GUID generation of TwinCAT.

### Code of interest
```
// Declaration ------------------------------------------------------

PROGRAM MAIN
VAR
	trigger : BOOL := TRUE;
	createGuid : FB_CreateGuid;
	guid : GUID;
	guidAsString : STRING;
END_VAR

// Program ----------------------------------------------------------

IF NOT createGuid.bBusy AND trigger THEN	
	
	trigger := FALSE;
	createGuid(bExecute := FALSE);	
	createGuid(
			bExecute := TRUE,
			pGuidBuffer := ADR(guid),
			nGuidBufferSize := SIZEOF(guid));
			
ELSIF createGuid.bBusy THEN
	
	createGuid();	
	
END_IF

// The code abover this point does not require any further libraries.  
// ------------------------------------------------------------------
// The code below requires Tc2_Utilites

guidAsString := GUID_TO_STRING(guid);

```

## Install 
Not required.  Simply open the project.

## TwinCAT
This project uses TcXaeShell 3.1.4024.11

## Getting started
This is not a guide for TcXaeShell, please visit http://beckhoff.com/ for further guides
* Open the included TwinCAT project and activate on your local machine
* Login and set the PLC running
* The first cycle will activate the creation of a GUID.  For further generation set the trigger to TRUE.
